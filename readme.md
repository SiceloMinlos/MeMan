Welcome good people to my version of **PACMAN**

**Technologies used:**

1. Vanilla JavaScript
2. HTML
3. CSS

**Ghosts Algorithm**

The ghosts travel a random route depending on the number of free spots to go. There is a predictor
function which predicts future moves, if there is no collision in the future move, the move is stored in a 
list and the ghost will randomly choose a move from that list

**PACMAN MOVEMENT**

So Mr PACMAN moves using the good old 'WASD' keys, the collision detection function prevents him from
going through the walls

**Final Remarks**
Building PACMAN from scratch was really fun, realised that JavaScript is really cool, learnt about ternary operators,
spread operators, destructuring event operators. I really hope you have fun playing this game as much as I did
building it ^_^
